#This is the default Pentoo make.conf file, it controls many basic system settings.
#You can find information on how to edit this file in "man make.conf" as well as
#on the web at https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki//etc/portage/make.conf

#Please adjust your CFLAGS as desired, information can be found here: https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/CFLAGS
#Do not modify these FLAGS unless you know what you are doing, always check the defaults first with "portageq envvar CFLAGS"
#This is the default for pentoo at the time of build:
#CFLAGS="-Os -march=pentium-m -mtune=nocona -pipe -fomit-frame-pointer  -frecord-gcc-switches"
#A safe choice would be to keep whatever Pentoo defaults are, but optimize for your specific machine:
#CFLAGS="${CFLAGS} -march=native"
#If you do change your CFLAGS, it is best for all the compile flags to match so uncomment the following three lines:
#CXXFLAGS="${CFLAGS}"
#FCFLAGS="${CFLAGS}"
#FFLAGS="${CFLAGS}"

#Please adjust your use flags, if you don't use gpu cracking, it is probably safe to remove cuda and opencl
USE="binary-drivers cuda opencl qemu -doc -examples -gtk-autostart"
USE="${USE} aufs bindist livecd"

#MAKEOPTS is set automatically by the profile to jobs equal to processors, you do not ne to set it.

#Please set your input devices, if you are only using evdev you may completely remove this line
INPUT_DEVICES="evdev keyboard mouse synaptics synaptics"

#Default VIDEO_CARDS setting enables nearly everything, you can enable fewer here if you like:
#At a minimum you should have these PLUS your specific videocard
#VIDEO_CARDS="vesa vga fbdev"
#you can check available options with "emerge -vp xorg-drivers"
